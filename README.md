# ReasoningModel

## Overview
The ReasoningModel is a comprehensive, iterative AI framework designed to solve complex problems by continually refining its reasoning capabilities. Its structure allows for contextless AI to be deployed in solving tasks, improving itself over time based on feedback loops and predefined reasoning constants.

## Features
- **Context-Free**: The model does not rely on prior information and adapts iteratively to improve performance.
- **Iterative Refinement**: With every iteration, the model improves its reasoning, ensuring more accurate results over time.
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked, and a downloadable archive is generated after each iteration.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The model evaluates problems using a probabilistic framework, making it flexible and adaptive.

## How to Use
1. **Provide a Problem or Question**: The model processes the input and returns an optimal solution based on its reasoning constants.
2. **Let the Model Refine Itself**: If no question is provided, the model automatically iterates to improve its internal logic.
3. **Download the Archive**: After each iteration, the model generates a new version of the archive, which can be downloaded.
