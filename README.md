### Overview

Welcome to the **Causal Reasoning Framework**â€”an innovative approach to utilizing language models for causal understanding and decision-making. This project provides a structured way to guide models beyond simple imitation of human communication toward deeper insights through causal relationships in language.

### Features

- **Causal Understanding**: Models identify and leverage causal structures within language data.
- **Iterative Refinement**: In-built self-reflection mechanisms allow models to refine their responses and learn over time.
- **Modular Design**: Components can be added or modified for various use cases, allowing for flexible adaptation.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed for efficiency and scalability using AWS infrastructure (CloudFormation, S3, IAM).

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevius10/ReasoningModel.git
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured correctly. You will need the following environment variables set:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
   ```

3. **Deploy CloudFormation Stack**:
   Deploy the general infrastructure using the following command:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy \
     --template-file src/causal-infra/templates/general-template.yaml \
     --stack-name CausalInfraStack \
     --parameter-overrides Environment=const Reference=aws
   ```

4. **Backup Automation**:
   Ensure regular backups of the infrastructure and configurations using the provided backup script:
   ```bash
   bash src/causal-infra/scripts/backup.sh
   ```
