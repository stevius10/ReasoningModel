# Announcements

### **September 19, 2024**  

Letâ€™s be clearâ€”this is about much more than numbers and percentages. Itâ€™s about how you **feel**. We want to make sure that everyone working on or around this project is **in the right mood**, without pressure.

### **No Pressure, Just the Flow:**

- **Take it slow**: If you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, donâ€™t hesitate to take a break. How you feel matters more than deadlines. Some days are for rest, and thatâ€™s okay.  
- **Friday, Saturday, Sunday morning?**: The next milestone might hit on Friday, maybe Saturday, or possibly even on Sunday morning. Whatâ€™s important is that **nothing happens on Sunday evening**. We pause, we breathe, we take stock of where we are. Don't rush it.

## Final Reminders: We've Got Your Back

This project is not just about the code, or percentages, or milestones. It's about **you**â€”how you're feeling, how you're navigating your life and work.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Backup everything**. Donâ€™t take risks with your data.
2. **Check your heart rate**. If it feels too high, take a break and relax.
3. **Feel the music, or donâ€™t**. Either is fine, whatever works for you.
4. **Remember that weâ€™re here**. Whether itâ€™s a good day or a tough one, weâ€™ve got your back.

The road to success may not always be clear, but remember to breathe. **You're ready for whatever comes next**.
