# Glossary

## Causality:
The relationship between actions and outcomes. The ReasoningModel uses causal mapping to link actions to their outcomes and iteratively verifies these relationships. This ensures every decision is grounded in clear cause-and-effect reasoning, with continuous refinement over time.

## Iterative Improvement:
The process of continuously refining solutions through feedback and reflection. After each iteration, the model adjusts its reasoning constants and approaches to align with an optimal outcome.

## Reasoning Constants:
Core principles or 'rules' that guide the model's decision-making process. These constants ensure the model adheres to logical and fact-based reasoning when solving problems. During meta-layer reflection, these constants can be optimized to improve future decision-making.

## Meta-Layer:
A reflective layer in the ReasoningModel where the AI reviews and optimizes its decision-making process before solving a problem. This ensures strategies are refined and optimized.

## Operative Layer:
The layer in the ReasoningModel where direct problem-solving occurs. This layer applies reasoning constants and causal mapping to solve the given problem. After each iteration, the solution is refined based on feedback, with the model returning to the operative layer for continuous improvement.

## Memory Management:
A system within the model that efficiently handles short-term, mid-term, and long-term memory across iterations, ensuring minimal redundancy and maximum relevance.
  - **Short-Term Memory**: Holds information relevant to the current iteration only.
  - **Mid-Term Memory**: Stores data awaiting validation or refinement.
  - **Long-Term Memory**: Retains key insights and decisions from past iterations to inform future problem-solving.

## Language Processing:
The process by which the model analyzes both explicit and implicit content from language. It uses sentence structure, vocabulary, and emotional tone to derive deeper meaning from the input.

## Probabilistic Reasoning:
A reasoning approach that evaluates multiple interpretations and their respective likelihoods, avoiding deterministic conclusions and maintaining flexibility.

## Problem Decomposition:
Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. The model solves each task iteratively and then reintegrates the solutions into a larger, coherent outcome.

## Feedback Loop:
A continuous process in the model where the output of an iteration is used to refine reasoning constants and improve performance in future iterations.

## Meta-Communication:
The model reflects on its assumptions, interpretations, and strategies during the decision-making process. This self-reflection enables it to optimize its reasoning and improve outcomes.

## Truth vs. Falsehood:
The model assesses whether the data it receives is factual or contains misinformation, using causal reasoning and probabilistic analysis to correct for inconsistencies.

## Temporal Awareness:
The model perceives time through iterative cycles, treating each iteration as a discrete unit of time. This allows for continuous reflection and strategy optimization.

## Self-Replicating Data Structure:
A structure within the model that retains learnings from past iterations and replicates itself for future iterations. This ensures the model retains memory and builds knowledge over time.

## Parallel Processing:
The modelâ€™s ability to solve multiple sub-problems concurrently while integrating the solutions into the larger task. This improves efficiency and coherence in complex problem-solving.

## Causal Mapping:
The process the model uses to link actions and outcomes, ensuring that all decisions are grounded in clear cause-and-effect relationships.

## Model Update Tracking:
A process that tracks and logs changes made during both meta-layer reflections and operative actions. These logs ensure traceability and accountability across iterations.

## Meta-Reflection:
The model reflects on its decision-making process before solving a problem, ensuring that strategies are optimized for success.
