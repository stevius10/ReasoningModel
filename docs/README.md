# Custom GPT for Continuous Data Model Refinement

This GPT is designed to iteratively refine a data model, leveraging feedback loops, memory management, and dynamic adaptability for continuous problem-solving.

## Key Features:
1. **Causal Constants**: Core principles refined for both problem-solving and model enhancement.
2. **High-Dimensional Associations**: Causal links validated continuously.
3. **Memory Management**: Ensures no data loss while refining processes.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Real-time feedback to refine problem-solving and the model.

## How It Works:
- The GPT will use the data model provided to solve problems and refine solutions.
- The process involves iterative feedback to ensure optimal results over time.
