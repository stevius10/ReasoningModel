# Methodology

## Introduction
The **ReasoningModel** follows a structured and iterative approach to solving problems, built upon the principles of **causal reasoning**, **problem decomposition**, and **iterative refinement**. This framework operates within two layers: 
1. **The operative layer**, where direct problem-solving occurs.
2. **The meta-layer**, where reflection and strategy optimization take place before solving the problem.

The frameworkâ€™s key strength lies in its ability to continuously learn and improve, leveraging **memory management** and **language processing** to optimize decision-making with every iteration.

## Principles

1. **Reasoning Constants**: Core principles ensure that the model consistently adheres to **logical, fact-based reasoning** when solving problems. All decisions are grounded in **causal relationships**.
   
2. **Iterative Refinement**: After each iteration, the model reflects on its performance, refining its reasoning strategies and aligning closer with the optimal solution.
   
3. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The model evaluates multiple interpretations and selects the most probable outcome. It avoids deterministic conclusions, using probabilistic assessments to maintain flexibility in reasoning.

4. **Meta-Communication and Reflection**: The model critically assesses its decision-making process, questioning whether it has appropriately interpreted both **explicit** and **implicit** information. It reflects on its assumptions, adjusting strategies accordingly.

5. **Truth vs. Falsehood and Uncertainty**: The model assesses whether the data contains **misinformation** or biased content. Through **causal analysis** and **probabilistic reasoning**, the model identifies potential inconsistencies in the input and makes necessary adjustments to ensure accuracy.

6. **Memory Management**: 
   - **Short-term memory** holds context-specific information relevant to the current task.
   - **Mid-term memory** stores data awaiting validation for future use.
   - **Long-term memory** retains key insights to inform future decisions, enabling the model to continually build upon past learnings.

## Iteration and Refinement Process

1. **Initialization**: The model begins in an empty, contextless state, applying predefined **reasoning constants** to process incoming data.
   
2. **Problem Decomposition**: The model divides complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, solving each sub-task before integrating it into the larger solution.

3. **Meta-Layer Reflection**: 
   - The model reviews its reasoning strategy at the **meta-layer**, critically analyzing its approach to ensure the chosen strategy is optimized before any problem-solving begins.
   - After reflection, the model moves to the **operative layer**, where the actual problem-solving occurs.

4. **Solving the Problem**: The model applies **causal mapping** to link actions and outcomes, ensuring that every step of the problem-solving process is grounded in **clear causal reasoning**.

5. **Feedback and Self-Correction**: 
   - After each iteration, the model assesses feedback and refines its reasoning constants and strategies.
   - This process is repeated until the model reaches a **satisfactory solution**.

6. **Parallelized Reasoning**: 
   - For complex tasks, the model can solve multiple sub-problems concurrently, parallelizing its reasoning while maintaining coherence across the task.

7. **Memory Building and Learning**: 
   - After each iteration, the model stores key learnings in a **self-replicating data structure**, allowing it to **improve** with every new cycle.
   - The model uses its **short, mid, and long-term memory** to retain relevant insights for future iterations.

## Temporal Awareness and Feedback Loops

The model operates through discrete **time cycles**, where each iteration represents a unit of time. After each cycle, the model reflects on the current task and adjusts strategies based on feedback.

- **Meta-layer Reflection**: Allows the model to reassess its reasoning process before each iteration.
- **Operative Layer**: Handles the direct problem-solving based on the refined strategy from the meta-layer.
- **Memory Management**: Ensures that knowledge is retained across iterations, avoiding redundancy and improving relevance with every cycle.

## Conclusion

The **ReasoningModel** is built to iteratively solve problems, reflect on its processes, and improve over time. By leveraging **causal reasoning**, **memory management**, and **language processing**, the model achieves scalable, context-aware decision-making that aligns with its original design. It can adapt to complex tasks by breaking them down, reflecting on its strategy, and continuously refining its reasoning to reach an optimal solution.
