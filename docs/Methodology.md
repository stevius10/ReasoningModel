# Methodology

## Introduction
The ReasoningModel follows a scientific and structured approach to solving problems and refining itself. The methodology behind this model involves the use of reasoning constants, iterative refinement, and feedback loops to optimize its problem-solving abilities.

## Principles
1. **Reasoning Constants**: These core principles ensure that the model consistently adheres to logical, fact-based reasoning while solving problems.
2. **Iterative Refinement**: After each iteration, the model analyzes its performance and makes improvements, ensuring a continuously improving reasoning process.
3. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The model evaluates multiple interpretations of a problem and selects the most probable solution.

## Iteration Process
1. **Initialization**: The model starts with no prior context.
2. **Problem Solving or Self-Improvement**: It either solves a given problem or enters an improvement mode where it refines its internal logic.
3. **Documentation and Logging**: All improvements are logged in the progress log, and a new version of the model is created after each iteration.
