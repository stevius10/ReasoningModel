# Test Scenarios

## Overview
This document outlines the test cases for validating the ReasoningModel. The model’s core components, including iterative improvement, memory management, and causal mapping, are tested to ensure that the framework functions as intended.

---

## Test Cases

### 1. Iterative Problem Solving
- **Objective**: Verify that the model correctly iterates and improves its solutions over time.
- **Test**: Input a problem and check the outputs after several iterations.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model's solution should improve with each iteration, refining reasoning constants and adapting based on feedback.

### 2. Memory Management
- **Objective**: Test whether the model appropriately manages short-term, mid-term, and long-term memory across iterations.
- **Test**: Present the model with a problem that requires it to recall previous iterations.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should store relevant information and discard unnecessary data, showing the ability to access and utilize long-term memory when needed.

### 3. Causal Mapping
- **Objective**: Ensure that the model accurately maps actions to outcomes using causal relationships.
- **Test**: Provide a set of actions and verify that the model links each action to a corresponding outcome based on causal reasoning. Check whether these causal links are verified and refined in subsequent iterations.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should clearly link actions to outcomes, demonstrating a deep understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.

### 4. Probabilistic Reasoning
- **Objective**: Test the model’s ability to evaluate multiple interpretations and select the most probable outcome.
- **Test**: Present the model with ambiguous data and observe how it assesses probabilities for different interpretations.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should choose the most likely interpretation while avoiding deterministic conclusions.

### 5. Meta-Layer Reflection
- **Objective**: Validate that the model reflects on its reasoning strategies before solving a problem.
- **Test**: Input a problem and examine the logs for meta-layer reflections before the operative layer takes action.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should log reflections on its strategy and adjust reasoning constants where necessary. These changes should lead to observable improvements in subsequent iterations.

### 6. Parallel Processing
- **Objective**: Test the model’s ability to handle multiple sub-tasks concurrently.
- **Test**: Present the model with a complex problem that can be broken into sub-problems.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should process multiple sub-tasks in parallel while maintaining coherence in the overall solution.

### 7. Self-Replication and Memory Building
- **Objective**: Ensure that the model’s memory structure replicates itself after each iteration, allowing the model to retain knowledge.
- **Test**: Run several iterations and check whether the model’s data structure retains learnings from previous iterations.
- **Expected Outcome**: The model should effectively replicate its memory structure and use it for future iterations.
