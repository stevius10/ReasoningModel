# Test Scenarios

## Example 1: Problem Solving
**Prompt**: What is the best strategy to learn AI efficiently?
**Expected Output**: The model processes the input and returns an optimal strategy based on reasoning constants.

## Example 2: Self-Improvement Mode
**Scenario**: No problem is provided, and the model enters self-improvement mode.
**Expected Outcome**: The model iterates to refine its reasoning abilities and logs changes in the progress log.

## Example 3: Iterative Problem Solving
**Prompt**: How can AI be used to optimize logistics?
**Expected Output**: The model evaluates multiple approaches and returns the most probable solution based on the data.
